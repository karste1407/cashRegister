# cashRegister
Trying to make a cashregister.html with javascript.
 So far what I thought would happen was that:
 when you press one of the things in the list, it will use the scan method on that produduct. Then append that to the total. 
 
 This is not happening, trying to figure out why.
 
 Help please??
